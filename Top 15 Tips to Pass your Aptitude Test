1) Practice Aptitude tests online
It’s more than likely you’ll sit your aptitude test on a computer so get used to practicing them online.

2) Get all the right tools
When tackling the numerical reasoning test ensure you have a good calculator, lots of rough paper, a few pens and a watch. 
Get used to practicing with all these essentials so you’re used to using them when it comes to your real assessment.

3) Preparation is the key
Practice as many aptitude tests as you can before sitting your assessment. 
The more questions you practice the more confident you will be and the more types of questions you will have seen.

4) Do your research
Ask the assessor for information on the type of test you’ll be sitting. 
You have the right to ask what sort of aptitude test you’ll be expected to sit, how long it will be and where you’ll have to sit it (it might be at home or at an assessment centre).

5) Get comfortable taking tests
Make sure you’re in a comfortable environment when you practice your aptitude tests.
Don’t sit them just before going out or when you’re going to be disturbed.
It’s important to give them your full attention both when practicing and when taking your real assessment.

6) Use the assessors resources
Take the practice test offered by the assessor if possible. Before sitting aptitude tests you’ll often be given practice questions to have a go at.
They’re normally called worked example, have a go at those to get a flavour for the type of questions you’ll be given.

7) Take tests on your own
Don’t get a friend to sit your aptitude test for you. 
If you’re asked to sit an aptitude test at home you may be asked to sit one when you go for interview so it’s no good trying to cheat the system. 
Also these tests are for your benefit as much as your prospective employer you both need to be comfortable your skills are up to the required standard
to do the job you’re applying for.

8) Carefully read the instructions
Read any guidance provided before sitting your assessment.
Make sure you make a note of how much time you have and roughly how long you should be spending on each question.

9) Avoid focusing on just one question
Don’t get bogged down on a question. If you get stuck, don’t let the clock run down,
move on, you might find the next question easier and you’ll pick up more marks by moving on.

10) Keep moving forwards
Move on. If you think a question is going to take a really long time, flag it and if possible come back to it. 
Some questions can be really time consuming and you may be better off coming back to it.

11) Avoid the scattergun approach
Don’t guess wildly. Your aptitude test score will be made up of a combination of speed and accuracy.
It’s important not to haphazardly guess to try and finish all the questions. Work carefully and as quickly as you can. 
The more questions you practice the quicker you will get.

12) More speed, less haste
Spend a few seconds familiarising yourself with the graph, table or passage you’re presented with before launching into the question. 
This is particularly important in the verbal reasoning test where you might have to read long passages of information.

13) Use the correct tools
Get used to working on paper. The quickest way to do your calculations is on a piece of paper. 
We recommend using a big A4 sheet as you’ll have enough room to do your workings. Leave yourself plenty of space so you’re not cramming your workings into the corner.

14) Use feedback to keep getting better
In reality, you’re not going to pass every test you face. Request feedback on your performance from your assessor. 
Find out how many questions you got right and where you could improve.

15) Use a good calculator
Don’t use your phone or a very small calculator. Make sure you are familiar with the calculator you’re using and comfortable with where all the buttons are. 
The quicker you are with your calculator the higher you will score.
