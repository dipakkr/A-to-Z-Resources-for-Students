```

## Working with multiple files

:bprev or :bp # go to the previous buffer
:bd           # delete a buffer (close a file)
:ls           # list all open buffers
:sp file      # open a file in a new buffer and split window
:vsp file     # open a file in a new buffer and vertically split window
Ctrl + ws     # split window
Ctrl + ww     # switch windows
Ctrl + wq     # quit a window
Ctrl + wv     # split window vertically
Ctrl + wh     # move cursor to the left window (vertical split)
Ctrl + wl     # move cursor to the right window (vertical split)
Ctrl + wj     # move cursor to the window below (horizontal split)
Ctrl + wk     # move cursor to the window above (horizontal split)
```

## Tabs
```bash
:tabnew or :tabnew file # open a file in a new tab
Ctrl + wT               # move the current split window into its own tab
gt or :tabnext or :tabn # move to the next tab
gT or :tabprev or :tabp # move to the previous tab
<number>gt              # move to tab <number>
:tabmove <number>       # move current tab to the <number>th position (indexed from 0)
:tabclose or :tabc      # close the current tab and all its windows
:tabonly or :tabo       # close all tabs except for the current one
:tabdo command          # run the command on all tabs (e.g. :tabdo q - closes all opened tabs)
```
