## Search and replace
```bash
/pattern       # search for pattern
?pattern       # search backward for pattern
\vpattern      # 'very magic' pattern: non-alphanumeric characters are interpreted as special regex symbols (no escaping needed)
n              # repeat search in same direction
N              # repeat search in opposite direction
:%s/old/new/g  # replace all old with new throughout file
:%s/old/new/gc # replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations
:noh           # remove highlighting of search matches
```

## Search in multiple files
```bash
:vimgrep /pattern/ {file} # search for pattern in multiple files
:cn                       # jump to the next match
:cp                       # jump to the previous match
:copen                    # open a window containing the list of matches
```

## Exiting
```bash
:w              # write (save) the file, but don't exit
:w !sudo tee %  # write out the current file using sudo
:wq or :x or ZZ # write (save) and quit
:q              # quit (fails if there are unsaved changes)
:q! or ZQ       # quit and throw away unsaved changes
```

## Working with multiple files
```bash
:e file       # edit a file in a new buffer
:bnext or :bn # go to the next buffer
:bprev or :bp # go to the previous buffer
:bd           # delete a buffer (close a file)
:ls           # list all open buffers
:sp file      # open a file in a new buffer and split window
:vsp file     # open a file in a new buffer and vertically split window
Ctrl + ws     # split window
Ctrl + ww     # switch windows
Ctrl + wq     # quit a window
Ctrl + wv     # split window vertically
Ctrl + wh     # move cursor to the left window (vertical split)
Ctrl + wl     # move cursor to the right window (vertical split)
Ctrl + wj     # move cursor to the window below (horizontal split)
Ctrl + wk     # move cursor to the window above (horizontal split)
```

## Tabs
```bash
:tabnew or :tabnew file # open a file in a new tab
Ctrl + wT               # move the current split window into its own tab
gt or :tabnext or :tabn # move to the next tab
gT or :tabprev or :tabp # move to the previous tab
<number>gt              # move to tab <number>
:tabmove <number>       # move current tab to the <number>th position (indexed from 0)
:tabclose or :tabc      # close the current tab and all its windows
:tabonly or :tabo       # close all tabs except for the current one
:tabdo command          # run the command on all tabs (e.g. :tabdo q - closes all opened tabs)
```
