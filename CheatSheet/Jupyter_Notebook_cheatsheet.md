# Jupyter Notebook

* Documenting Notebook using Markdown 

* Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* It is used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

# Headings
Use the number sign (#) followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:
# for titles
## for major headings
### for subheadings
#### for 4th level subheadings

# Emphasis
Use the following code to emphasize text:
1. Bold text: __string__ or **string**
2. Italic text: _string_ or *string*

# Mathematical symbols
1. Surround mathematical symbols with a dollar sign ($), for example:
$ mathematical symbols $

# Line breaks
Sometimes markdown doesnâ€™t make line breaks when you want them. To force a linebreak, use the following code: <br>

# Bullets
* To create a circular bullet point, use one of the following methods. Each bullet point must be on its own line.
* A hyphen (-) followed by one or two spaces, for example: - Bulleted item
* A space, a hyphen (-) and a space, for example: - Bulleted item
* An asterisk (*) followed by one or two spaces, for example: * Bulleted item
* To create a sub bullet, press Tab before entering the bullet point using one of the methods described above. For example:
- Main bullet point
     - Sub bullet point
     
# Internal links
* To link to a section within your notebook, use the following code:
[Section title](#section-title)
