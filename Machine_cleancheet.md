# Top-down learning path: Machine Learning for Software Engineers




---

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough
I get discouraged from books and courses that tell me as soon as I open them that multivariate calculus, inferential statistics and linear algebra are prerequisites. I still don’t know how to get started…

- [What if I’m Not Good at Mathematics](http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-if-im-not-good-at-mathematics/)
- [5 Techniques To Understand Machine Learning Algorithms Without the Background in Mathematics](http://machinelearningmastery.com/techniques-to-understand-machine-learning-algorithms-without-the-background-in-mathematics/)
- [How do I learn machine learning?](https://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1)

## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes
are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. I'm going to be adding more videos
from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This short section were prerequisites/interesting info I wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan.

- [ ] [What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1)

- [ ] [Don’t Break The Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
- [ ] [How to learn on your own](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/learn_on_your_own)

## The Daily Plan

Each subject does not require a whole day to be able to understand it fully, and you can do multiple of these in a day.

Each day I take one subject from the list below, read it cover to cover, take notes, do the exercises and write an implementation in Python or R.
